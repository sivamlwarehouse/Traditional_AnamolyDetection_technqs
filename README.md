This rep contains different traditional anamoly detection techniques


Your task to build network intrusion detection system to detect anomalies and attacks in the
Network


All The computer systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both technically difficult and economically costly to be solved by the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is Becoming more important. 
The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misusebased detection techniques for a long time

Conducting a thorough analysis of the recent research trend in anomaly detection, one will encounter several machine learning methods reported to have a very high detection rate of 98% ,While keeping the false alarm rate at 1%.
However, when we look at the state of the art IDS Solutions and commercial tools, there is no evidence of using anomaly detection approaches, and Practitioners still think that it is an immature technology.

To find the reason of this contrast, lots of research was done done in anomaly detection and considered various aspects such as learning and detection approaches, training data sets, testing data sets, and evaluation methods.
